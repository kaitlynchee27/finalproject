                At our ice cream bike in Kerrytown, we offer a unique and delightful menu that’s perfect for any sweet tooth! Our Ice Cream Donut is a crowd favorite—a warm, fluffy donut stuffed with your choice of creamy, freshly churned ice cream, and topped with delicious sprinkles or drizzled chocolate. For those looking for a cozy treat, we serve rich, velvety Hot Chocolate, made from premium cocoa and served with whipped cream or marshmallows for that extra indulgence. To complement your dessert, enjoy a freshly brewed Coffee, the perfect balance of bold flavors and smoothness, ideal for a quick pick-me-up or to pair with any of our sweet offerings. Whether you're enjoying a stroll through Kerrytown or relaxing at the market, our ice cream bike brings you the perfect combination of sweet and warm treats, all served with a smile and a dash of local charm!
